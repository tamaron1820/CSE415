"""run_3_class_4_feature_iris_data.py
NOTE: YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO ADD ANY CODE TO THIS FILE.
HOWEVER, YOU MAY WISH TO MAKE MINOR EDITS IN ORDER TO
SEE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE DATA AND WEIGHT VECTORS.

Train a multiclass perceptron on 30 examples in the
full irises data set, and then test on the rest.

The classification and training should NOT be done in
this file, but you should implement those in the file
ternary_perceptron.py.
That program will be imported and called from here.
